# Orion - A Full-Stack Application Built with Nuxt and Cloudflare

> [!NOTE]
> This application is built during live stream sessions on [Twitch](https://tv.soubiran.dev) (in French). Replays are available on [YouTube](https://yt.soubiran.dev) (in French) and [a blog article](https://soubiran.dev/posts/building-a-full-stack-nuxt-application-on-twitch) (in English) retraces the entire journey. Read it to deeply understand the choices made and the reasons behind them.

Orion is a web application to **centralize themes and templates** created by and for the Nuxt community. Anyone can submit a theme or a template he created to share it with the community. **Feel free to submit your own creation**!

This full-stack application is built with Nuxt and Nuxt UI Pro and deployed using NuxtHub and Cloudflare.
