      A template is a sample of an website or webapp with some details already in place. In the case of Orion, template are built around <a
        href="https://nuxt.com"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >Nuxt</a> technology and can be both a theme or a starter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea is to help the Nuxt community to kickstart their project with a solid base. So Orion is that place where Nuxt developers can discover, search, find and learn from a collection of templates built by the community for the Nuxt ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have built a template, free or paid, you can submit it to Orion and share it with the community. Orion is a great place to showcase your work and get feedback from the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Orion, you can easily access to source code to deep dive into the template and learn from it. You can also fork the template to start your project from it if the project permits it.

      Happy coding! ðŸš€
